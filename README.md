Please follow GitHub Flow, with the following additions:

Ensure an issue exists before you begin work. If not, file one.
Your change should provide obvious material benefit to the project's users and/or developers. If in doubt, an issue serves as place to discuss your suggestion before you begin work.
Issues power the release changelogs, so your change will be made known to users after it's done.
One PR per issue. Include the issue number in your commit(s) and PR so that merging it will close the issue.
One issue per PR. Keep changes minimal, and keep the scope narrow. A small change is easier to review.
Avoid making formatting changes alongside functionality changes. This is a recipe for conflicts.
Avoid bumping version numbers or correcting spelling errors along with your changes unless they're necessary.
Feel free to make these sorts of corrections in a separate PR, though!
